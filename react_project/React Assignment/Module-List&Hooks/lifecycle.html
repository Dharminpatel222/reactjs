The React lifecycle: methods and hooks explained


A React component undergoes three different phases in its lifecycle, including mounting, updating, and unmounting. Each
phase has specific methods responsible for a particular stage in a component's lifecycle. These methods are technically
particular to class-based components and not intended for functional components.

However, since the concept of Hooks was released in React, you can now use abstracted versions of these lifecycle
methods when you’re working with functional component state. Simply put, React Hooks are functions that allow you to
“hook into” a React state and the lifecycle features within function components.

In this post, you'll learn more about the React component lifecycle and the different methods within each phase (for
class-based components), focusing particularly on methods and hooks.

Phases of a React component's lifecycle
A React component undergoes three phases in its lifecycle: mounting, updating, and unmounting.

The mounting phase is when a new component is created and inserted into the DOM or, in other words, when the life of a
component begins. This can only happen once, and is often called “initial render.”
The updating phase is when the component updates or re-renders. This reaction is triggered when the props are updated or
when the state is updated. This phase can occur multiple times, which is kind of the point of React.
The last phase within a component's lifecycle is the unmounting phase, when the component is removed from the DOM.
In a class-based component, you can call different methods for each phase of the lifecycle (more on this below). These
lifecycle methods are of course not applicable to functional components because they can only be written/contained
within a class. However, React hooks give functional components the ability to use states.

Hooks have gaining popularity because they make working with React cleaner and often less verbose.

React lifecycle methods
Let’s learn more about the methods that make up each of our three phases.

The mounting phase
In the mounting phase, a component is prepared for and actually inserted into the DOM. To get through this phase, four
lifecycle methods are called: constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, and componentDidMount.

The constructor method
The constructor method is the very first method called during the mounting phase.

It's important to remember that you shouldn't add any side effects within this method (like sending an HTTP request) as
it's intended to be pure.

This method is mostly used for initializing the state of the component and binding event-handler methods within the
component. The constructor method is not necessarily required. If you don't intend to make your component stateful (or
if that state doesn’t need to be initialized) or bind any method, then it’s not necessary to implement.

The constructor method is called when the component is initiated, but before it’s rendered. It’s also called with props
as an argument. It's important you call the super(props) function with the props argument passed onto it within the
constructor before any other steps are taken.

This will then initiate the constructor of React.Component (the parent of this class-based component) and it inherits
the constructor method and other methods of a typical React component.

For example, below you can see a class-based component implementation of a counter with a constructor in it, where the
state is initialized and an event-handler method is bound (ignore the render method for now):
